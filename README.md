# Advent of Code Leaderboard Client

This script takes the JSON from Advent of Code leaderboards and 
formats it into a leaderboard with absolute times instead of stars. 
It then outputs it into a ~~md~~ file. Markdown may be fixed or not.

It Gets your input from AoC. Just create a file `myCookie.txt` and paste your cookie  from AoC in it. Run with `npm start`. 
Getting cookies programmatically is ~~WIP~~ hard. Right now you can find your cookie in your preferred browser.

## Requirements

- Node 15
- AoC leaderboard

## Example output

The repo includes example output in Leaderboard 1.md.
